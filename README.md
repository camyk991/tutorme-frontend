# TutorMe

First place in a competition organized by the Stowarzyszenie SÄ…decki Elektryk and the National-Louis University Business School for the TutorMe project.

TutorMe is a project aimed at mutual assistance in learning through video chat tutoring. Users post announcements indicating the subject and topic they need help with, and others who are interested in that field offer teaching services. As the scheduled lesson approaches, a chat room is created for users to join.

Project is deployed here: https://tutorme-frontend.onrender.com/

Frontend made using React, backend made in Node with Express framework. App uses MongoDB.
Video calls made with Agora SDK.
